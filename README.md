## Summary
This is a driverless (no USB drivers needed, even on Windows) USB HID bootloader
for **STM32F10x** and **STM32F4xx** devices. 

It doesn't use ST libraries since they are bloated and buggy. Only CMSIS and
some required system files and macros have been used from ST provided SDK.

This allowed for a very small bootloader ~~4 KB~~ **2 KB** on `STM32F10x` devices. On `STM32F4xx` devices there is no point to make the bootloader much smaller than 16 KB because the first flash page is already 16 KB.


This repo is based on **bootsector's**  [stm32-hid-bootloader](https://github.com/bootsector/stm32-hid-bootloader) repository but is customized to follows the [Arduino_Core_STM32](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32) Core requirements. The source files (Bootloader and CLI) can be compiled on ***Windows***, ***Linux*** or ***Mac***.


For your convenience, you can find [here](https://github.com/Serasidis/STM32_HID_Bootloader/releases) the **hid-flash** tool for these three platforms and the F1 and F4 firmware binaries. 

## Installing the HID bootloader to STM32 devices

### (ST-Link version)

1. Download the [latest HID Bootloader](https://github.com/Serasidis/STM32_HID_Bootloader/releases) release
2. Download the [texane stlink](https://github.com/texane/stlink/releases/tag/1.3.0) according to your operating system (Windows, MacOSX, Linux)
3. Extract the texane stlink to your hard disk. You will need the file ```st-flash``` (it is into the bin folder).
4. Copy into that folder the HID Bootloader file (xxx.bin) according to your board. e.g. ```hid_generic_pc13.bin``` file is for **BluePill** board, ```hid_maple_mini.bin``` is for **Maple Mini** board etc. The on-board LED is connectet to the PC13 pin.
5. Connect ```BOOT-0``` and ```BOOT-1``` pins (or on-board jumpers) to GND ('0' on BluePill board) 
6. Type on Windows CMD (or Linux terminal) ```st-flash.exe write hid_generic_pc13.bin 0x8000000``` for programming the HID Bootloader firmware to a **BluePill** board.
7. Apply the ```Arduino_STM32_patch``` from [here](https://github.com/Serasidis/STM32_HID_Bootloader) in case of using Roger's Core (select the zip file according to your Operating System). 
8. Select from Arduino IDE ```Tools > Board > [your_stm32_board]```
9. Select  ```Tools > Upload method > HID Bootloader 2.1``` or newer 
10. You are ready !

Normally, both ```BOOT-0``` and ```BOOT-1``` must be connected to '0'. If you connect ```BOOT-1``` pin to 3.3V (or '1' on BluePill boards), the board will stay in HID Bootloader mode.  
  

### (Serial Dongle version)

1. Download the [latest HID Bootloader](https://github.com/Serasidis/STM32_HID_Bootloader/releases) release
2. Download the [stm32flash](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/tree/master/tools) from Roger's Clark Github repo.
3. Extract the stm32flash to your hard disk.
4. Copy into that folder the HID Bootloader file (xxx.bin) according to your board. e.g. ```hid_generic_pc13.bin``` file is for **BluePill** board, ```hid_maple_mini.bin``` is for **Maple Mini** board etc The on-board LED is connectet to the PC13 pin.
5. Set ```BOOT-0``` pin to '1' (3.3V) and reset the board
6. Type on Windows CMD (or Linux terminal) ```stm32flash.exe -g 0x8000000 -b 115200 -w hid_generic_pc13.bin COM2 ``` or ```stm32flash -g 0x8000000 -b 115200 -w hid_generic_pc13.bin /dev/ttyS0``` for programming the HID Bootloader firmware to a **BluePill** board.
7. Apply the ```Arduino_STM32_patch``` from [here](https://github.com/Serasidis/STM32_HID_Bootloader) in case of using Roger's Core (select the zip file according to your Operating System). 
8. Select from Arduino IDE ```Tools > Board > [your_stm32_board]```
9. Select  ```Tools > Upload method > HID Bootloader 2.1``` or newer 
10. You are ready !

## CLI folder

`cli` folder contains the source code for creating the command line tool **hid-flash** tool. 
This bootloader should't have any compiler restrictions, so it should work with
any GCC ARM toolchain version (latest is always recommended!). Just run 'make' on that folder.

The `hid-flash` binary tool (executable) is also included in the [latest HID Bootloader](https://github.com/Serasidis/STM32_HID_Bootloader/releases) release

### Linux udev setup:

To use the HID bootloader without root permissions the following udev rule needs to be installed to the `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-stm32_hid_bl.rules`

```
# STM32_HID_bootloader
ATTRS{idProduct}=="beba", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1209", MODE:="666" 
```

You might need to reboot or run ```udevadm control --reload-rules``` and replug your device to use it as a normal user after installing.


### Windows examples:

```[YOUR_HDD_PATH]\STM32_HID_bootloader\cli>make clean``` Clears the previous generated files
```[YOUR_HDD_PATH]\STM32_HID_bootloader\cli>make``` Creates the **hid-flash.exe** file


## Bootloader folder
`bootloader` folder contains the source code for creating the **hid_bootloader.bin** file that is burned into the STM32F103 flash memory. Currently, only **STM32F103** MCU is supported. Making the ***hid_bootloader.bin***

### Examples:
***STM32F10x***

```[YOUR_HDD_PATH]\STM32_HID_bootloader\bootloader\F1>make clean``` Clears the previous generated files
```[YOUR_HDD_PATH]\STM32_HID_bootloader\bootloader\F1>make generic-pc13``` Creates the **hid_bootloader.bin** file, assigning the LED to pin PC13. Edit the ***make_all.bat*** file to see all supported pin options.


If you want to use a ***High Density Device*** such as ***STM32F103RCT6**, then you have to add an extra argument to the ```make``` command.

**Example:** ```[YOUR_HDD_PATH]\STM32_HID_bootloader\bootloader\F1>make generic-pd2 PAGE_SIZE=2048``` Creates the **hid_bootloader.bin** file, assigning the LED to pin PD2. Edit the ***make_all_hd.bat*** file to see all supported pin options.



***STM32F4xx***

```[YOUR_HDD_PATH]\STM32_HID_bootloader\bootloader\F4>make clean``` Clears the previous generated files

```[YOUR_HDD_PATH]\STM32_HID_bootloader\bootloader\F4>make build_f407_vgt6_pe0``` Creates the **f407_vgt6_pe.bin** file and copies it to the bootloader_only_binaries directory. Edit the Makefile to see all supported options

After compiling, the binary file can be found in:

```[YOUR_HDD_PATH]\STM32_HID_bootloader\bootloader\F4\build\hid_bootloader.bin```
